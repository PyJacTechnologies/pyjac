			<h3 class="tittle">After Surgery Home Care – Client Story</h3>
		</div>

		<p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 18px;">

			“We couldn’t have chosen anyone better to look after Mum.”

			Mrs. M, an independent 75-year-old, had an emergency back operation which left her unable to use the stairs
			at home. Her doctor recommended Cavendish Homecare and one of our team arrived within 12 hours of her
			discharge from hospital.

			After assessing the situation, we arranged for Registered Nurses day and night to care for her. As well as
			dressing her wounds, her Registered Nurse also administered medication, organised clinical appointments,
			looked after her personal care and diet, and worked with her Physiotherapist to help in the recovery of her
			mobility.

			We also arranged for a hospital bed, with a specialised mattress, to be on the ground floor of her home
			until she was able to use the stairs on her own.

			With regular updates and frequent visits from the He Healthcare team, Mrs. M and her family were very
			pleased with the care and support she was given.

			<h4 class="text-left">Why choose post-operative home care from us</h4>
			<br>
			Our person-centred approach means we go the extra mile to ensure everything is tailored to you. We provide
			an obligation-free home care assessment during which we discuss your requirements with you, your family and
			where appropriate your doctor and wider medical team. We create unique nursing and care packages that allow
			you to return home, confident in the knowledge that you have a Registered Nurse or Carer most-qualified to
			meet your needs.

			We are aware of the specialist needs of care for all operations and the complications which can occur during
			recovery, such as blood clots caused by inactivity. Our registered nurses can assist with taking prescribed
			medications and check up on how you are feeling, while monitoring healing of surgical wounds to spot any
			signs which may be of concern.

			<br>
			<br>
			<h4 class="text-left">Pricing of our post-operative home care packages?</h4><br>
			No matter what your specific needs are, we create a personalised plan to suit the care you require after
			surgery. If you’d like to discuss your post-operative home care needs and potential costs, please contact
			one of our experts who would be happy to help.
