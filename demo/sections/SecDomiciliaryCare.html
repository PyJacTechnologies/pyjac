		<br>

		<p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 18px;">Many older people can spend extended periods of time without
			having meaningful a conversation, which can reduce their quality of life.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you, or your loved one needs someone to have chat with and keep them company at home or during daily
			activities, our registered nurses and carers can provide elderly companion care of the highest standards.

		</p>

		<br>
		<h4 class="text-left">What is companion care?</h4>
		<br>

		This type of care is for those who do not need a lot of help but would like the companionship and support during
		their daily activities. This can have an emotional and cognitive benefit for elderly individuals due to the
		engaging conversations and reassurance when daily hassles or unfortunate life events occur.
		<br>
		<br>

		Some ways our carers provide companionship:
		<br>
		<br>

		<ol>

			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Suggesting engaging activities to enjoy</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Joining in on favourite hobbies and pastimes</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Accompaniment on daily tasks or outings to local events</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Getting to know friends and family when they visit or during group
				occasions</li>
		</ol>
