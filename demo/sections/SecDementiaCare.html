			People who suffer from dementia can feel lonely or isolated at times, which can be a deliberating strain on
			their quality of life. One way you can help reduce these feelings is to simply take the time to talk with
			the person who has dementia. This helps by building their confidence and reducing isolation.<br><br>
			Below we have outlined several tips for chatting to person with dementia:</p>
		<br>

		<ol>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Make time so you aren’t rushed</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Speak clearly and sit close enough for them to hear you</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Make sure their needs are met – e.g. the toilet, or are they hungry?</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Be conversational, don’t ask too many questions</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Be patient and don’t talk to them like they are a child</li>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">Give them simple choices so they are not overwhelmed</li>

		</ol>
